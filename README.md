# 👋 Hi, I'm Marco

I write TypeScript for a living and keep things simple: clear interfaces, small diffs, solid tests.  
Most days I'm building full-stack features (React/Next + Node/Nest + Prisma/Postgres) and wiring in AI/agent
workflows where they actually remove manual steps: reviews, test scaffolds, repo chores.

**Now**
- Adding practical agent flows into dev tooling (review, test, release)

Open for projects.

- TypeScript first; Python when useful (FFmpeg/automation)
- Frontend: React/Next, a bit of Vue
- Backend: Node/Nest, REST/GraphQL, queues, CI
- Pragmatic about legacy code and noisy repos
